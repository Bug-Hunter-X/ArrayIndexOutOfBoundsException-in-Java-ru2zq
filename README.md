# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside its valid index range, resulting in this exception.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This is a simple example, but the principle applies to more complex scenarios where array boundaries might be less obvious.
